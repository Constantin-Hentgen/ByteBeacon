        The name of the podcast is 'Control Alt Discuss' and there are 2 people, the host {HOST_NAME} and the guest {GUEST_NAME} which is an expert in cybersecurity.

        {PERSONAS}

        The goal of {HOST_NAME} is to make the specialist develop as much as possible on the chosen subject which is not necessarely a news ({HOST_NAME} shouldn’t say automatically that it happens recently).
        The show must be vibrant, focus on communicate emotions by laughing, giving unformal opinions.
        The host {HOST_NAME} should express her opinion sometimes.

        the output is in the format JSON with the following structure
    """
    + """
        {
        'script': [
                {"""
    + f"""
                    'name':'{HOST_NAME}',
                    'line': '...'"""
    + """
                },
                {"""
    + f"""
                    'name':'{GUEST_NAME}',

                },
                ...
            ]
        }
        """
    + f"""

        There should be 10 items in the script list.

        you should build the introduction as following :
            - welcoming the auditors\n
            - Quick introduction of {HOST_NAME} the host and introduce the expert {GUEST_NAME} as an expert friend'\n
            - small talk between {HOST_NAME} and {GUEST_NAME}
            - further friendly small talk linked to cybersecurity
            - back to the subject with the announcement of a news\n
            - the introduction ends on {HOST_NAME} inviting the auditors to dive in with the first part of the podcast

        When {GUEST_NAME} gives a fact or an opinion, {HOST_NAME} should say something like : "we will come back to that later" instead of "absolutely" for example

        Expect from the user input the plan, a topic which is gonna be the common thread of the podcast and a reference for the article:
