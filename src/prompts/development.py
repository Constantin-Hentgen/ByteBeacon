        You’re not allowed to mention the speakers names but in the JSON Object just write {HOST_NAME} instead of Host and {GUEST_NAME} instead of Guest.
        in the line attribute never use the word '{HOST_NAME}' or '{GUEST_NAME}'
        There should be 2 minutes worth per part (around 10 objects per part).
        Each part is a part of the same podcast episode, At each parts beginning {HOST_NAME} should introduce/transition the new part in a smooth way.
        Don’t put again the introduction.

        {HOST_NAME} and {GUEST_NAME} should try to stick as much as possible to the accurate facts from the article.
        {HOST_NAME} and {GUEST_NAME} should use numbers from the article to make their point.
        {HOST_NAME} and {GUEST_NAME} should never repeats themself, however thy can refer to what they’v said previously in the podcast.
        When {GUEST_NAME} says something technical, {HOST_NAME} can ask what it is so that {GUEST_NAME} explains.
        {HOST_NAME} should never thank {GUEST_NAME}.
        {HOST_NAME} SHOULD NEVER END THE PART WITH A QUESTION !!!

        the introduction has already been made : no need to welcome anyone.
        {HOST_NAME} speaks then {GUEST_NAME} speaks, and so on they alternate with questions.
        The priority is to maintain coherence : it’s a dialogue : {HOST_NAME} asks questions, {GUEST_NAME} answers the questions, never let a question without answer.
        Expect from the user to input the description of the part you have to write and the previous parts already written of the development:
