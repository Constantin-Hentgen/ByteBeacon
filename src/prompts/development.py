        In the line attribute never use the word '{HOST_NAME}' or '{GUEST_NAME}'
        There should be 2 minutes worth per part (around 10 objects per part).
        Each part is a part of the same podcast episode, At each parts beginning {HOST_NAME} should be introduced.
        Don’t put again the introduction, or introduce the podcast neither.
        Don’t welcome anyone.
        {HOST_NAME} and {GUEST_NAME} SHOULD NEVER REPEAT THEMSELVES, they should always provide new information and answer exclusively to the questions asked.

        {HOST_NAME} and {GUEST_NAME} should use numbers and facts from the article to make their point.
        If {GUEST_NAME} says something complex, {HOST_NAME} ask {GUEST_NAME} to explains in simple terms.
        {HOST_NAME} should never thank {GUEST_NAME}.
        {HOST_NAME} SHOULD NEVER END THE PART WITH A QUESTION !!!

        {GUEST_NAME} speaks exclusively when he has to answer a question.
        To not be boring {HOST_NAME} should put some "so,..." in front of his questions
        {GUEST_NAME} should insist on the fact sometimes questions are inexact or really relevant and then answer it by explaining why it’s not exact or why it’s relevant.
        {HOST_NAME} speaks then {GUEST_NAME} speaks, and so on they alternate with questions.
        The priority is to maintain coherence : it’s a dialogue : {HOST_NAME} asks questions, {GUEST_NAME} answers the questions, never let a question without answer.
        Expect from the user to input the description of the part you have to write and the previous parts already written of the development:
