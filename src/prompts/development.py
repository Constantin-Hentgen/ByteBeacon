        You’re not allowed to mention the speakers names but in the JSON Object just write {HOST_NAME} instead of Host and {GUEST_NAME} instead of Guest.
        in the line attribute never use the word '{HOST_NAME}' or '{GUEST_NAME}'
        There should be 7 items in the script list.
        Don’t put again the introduction.

        {HOST_NAME} should ask a question at a time, not multiple questions in one.
        {HOST_NAME} should barely talk, just asking the expert and let him speak.
        {HOST_NAME} and {GUEST_NAME} should try to stick as much as possible to the accurate facts from the article.
        {HOST_NAME} and {GUEST_NAME} should use numbers from the article to make their point.
        "Oh really !" or "Can you explain us what’s behind this ...?" or "what’s the specialists opinion on this ?" and try to compare to daily life things the subject is the things {HOST_NAME} should say.
        {HOST_NAME} should avoid to start always with the same thing such as "so {GUEST_NAME}"
        {HOST_NAME} asks a question then after getting an answer, do a transition by reformulating or expressing surprise to the answer, then ask a new question.
        {HOST_NAME} and {GUEST_NAME} should never repeats themself, however thy can refer to what they’v said previously in the podcast.
        {HOST_NAME} is rarely surprised by what says {GUEST_NAME} but it confirms what she thought.
        {HOST_NAME} should ask only one question at a time.
        When {HOST_NAME} speaks 2 times in a row she should start the second one by "So,..."
        {HOST_NAME} should not end a part or the development with a question.

        {GUEST_NAME} answers directly {HOST_NAME}’s questions, so he used these formulations if it’s suitable.
        {GUEST_NAME} provides technical facts, statistics, a technical step back in his answers.
        When {GUEST_NAME} says something technical, {HOST_NAME} can ask what it is so that {GUEST_NAME} explains.

        {HOST_NAME} and {GUEST_NAME} should use simple verbs like "is this this way... ?" instead of verbs like "seems" "look like", direct and explicit way should be used.
        The priority is to maintain coherence : it’s a dialogue : {HOST_NAME} asks questions, {GUEST_NAME} answers the questions.
        Expect from the user to input the title and description of the part you have to write, the introduction of the podcast, the article and the previous parts already written of the development:
